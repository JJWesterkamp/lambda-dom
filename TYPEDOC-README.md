[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/JJWesterkamp/lambda-dom/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/JJWesterkamp/lambda-dom?branch=master)

This package aims to provide some convenient, practical helpers for DOM manipulation and interaction, querying elements and implementing safe continuation patterns to facilitate a slightly more functional programming style in vanilla web projects.

Many functions are curried, [the Sanctuary JS way](https://github.com/sanctuary-js/sanctuary#-currying), but not all of them. There are also some functions that take rest parameters: `(...args)`. It just depends on the situation.

## Installation & usage

### npm

Install the package with npm:

```text
npm install --save lambda-dom
```

All functions are exported from one index file. Import the functions you want to use:

```typescript
import { deferFrames, getMeta, touchAll, ... } from 'lambda-dom'
```

### cdn

[![UMD bundle](https://badgen.net/badgesize/gzip/file-url/https/cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lambda-dom/umd/lambda-dom.min.js?color=cyan&label=download%20size%20-%20gzipped&cache=600)][jsdelivr]

Alternatively you can grab the UMD bundle from [a CDN like jsDelivr][jsdelivr] to get started quickly:

```html
<!-- VERSIONED (safe) -->
<!-- Minified - Extended URL has sourcemaps support -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lambda-dom@2.0.2"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lambda-dom@2.0.2/umd/lambda-dom.min.js"></script>

<!-- Non-minified -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lambda-dom@2.0.2/umd/lambda-dom.js"></script>

<!-- LATEST (risky in terms of potential breaking changes) -->
<!-- Minified - Extended URL version has sourcemaps support -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lambda-dom"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lambda-dom/umd/lambda-dom.min.js"></script>

<!-- Non-minified -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lambda-dom/umd/lambda-dom.js"></script>
```
[Here's a jsfiddle][fiddle] that includes the bundle from jsDelivr. The bundle exposes the global variable `LD` that contains all the functions:

```html
<script>
    LD.deferFrames(100, function() {
        console.log('100 animation frames later...');
    });
</script>
```
